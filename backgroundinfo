Name: CO2 Emissions
Description:
What are C02 emissions? C02 expresses the warming effect of different greenhouse gases as an equivalent amount of carbon dioxide. it is the amount of carbon dioxide that would give the same warming effect as each greenhouse gas that is emitted or stored by a sector/activity.
for example, methane, has a global warming potential of 25, which means 1 tonne of methane is 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions.

c02 is measured in grams, kg, or tonnes.

Name: Greenhouse gas
Description:

Greenhouse gas (GHG) is mainly responsible for increasing global temperatures due to both natural causes and anthropogenic activities. These are listed in the ghg sectors, the alarming rate of climate change is primarily influenced by these sectors such as agriculture practices.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION SECTORS & CALCULATIONS
https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-greenhouse-gas-emissions#:~:text=Land%20Use%2FForestry-,Overview,of%20these%20greenhouse%20gas%20emissions.

The world is warming faster than at any point in recorded history.

If heating continues, it will have a devastating impact on the planet, causing hunger flooded homes along the coast as well as more wildfires, hurricanes and droughts.

Ensuring a safe future below the 1.5Â°C mark requires the world to cut 30 gt greenhouse gas emissions annually by 2030. Transport and industry are not enough. We need to cut carbon emissions by managing our land and resources more efficiently, including building smart cities and curbing deforestation and food waste.

how can humankind get there? and what solution can be made?

SECTORS:

Agriculture

Commercial: from business and homes, the ghg emissions arise primarily from fossil fuels burned for heat and waste management.

Domestic (electricity + gas)

Industry ( electricity + gas): within the industry comes from burning fossil fuels for energy, as well as greenhouse gas emissions from certain chemical reactions necessary to produce goods from raw materials.

Electricity: (percentage) electricity production generates the second largest share of greenhouse gas emissions, coming from burning fossil fuels, mostly natural gas and coal.

LULUCF - lulucf stands for land use and forestry, land areas can act as a sink and absorb c0s from the atmosphere.
Public Sector

Transport: The transportation sector generates the largest share of ghg gas emissions. greenhouse gas emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuel for cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes. mostly 90% of the fuel used for transportation is petroleum based, which includes primarily gasoline and diesel.

Waste management

TRENDS:
since 2005, from year to year, emissions rised and fell due to the changes in the economy,
